# lfs-11.0
Work and Notes from doing LFS 11.0 on Rocky Linux 8


- Completed awhile before Christmas, was an interesting run thru.  saved the VM files and still need to put together my notes on this.
- Some interesting assumptions regarding the manual and the how people would build the system. 
- Modification needed to be made when dealing with VMs. namely VMware Workstation.  Still need to test on ESXi.
- Still want to do it again using maybe a live disk on my TR system to throw all 16 cores at it.
- Want to try and update the kernel.
- Also want to attempt to add a package manager.

Sketchy-Linux is a GO!
